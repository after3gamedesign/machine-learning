#  welcome to your first python lesson
#  these first lines of text are behind comments
#  to comment out a line of code use the '#'

#comment out this text
#print("uncomment this text and press Run")

#  Run compiles the Python code
#print('uncomment this text and press Run again.')

#  print is the first function we'll learn in python. instructions: uncomment and run each line of code in these examples.

#print(1+1)
#print('This '+'sentence '+'is '+ 'concatenated.')

# the print() function prints the data inside  parenthese; this area is where arguments are put;
# an argument is any variable needed for a function to pass

#  string data is being passed inside of this print function
#print('this is data type called string')

#  this is data type called a number
#number = 10
#print(number)

#  there are also data types that deal in true or false called boolean
#boo = True
#print(boo)
