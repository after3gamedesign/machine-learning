
What IS my idea???

Make the largest Teachable Machine camera project possible in the time span of 2 hours.

What DOES my idea do?

It recognizes things and shows how much percent of each of the options there are.

Materials:
-Google Chrome
-The camera on top of the computer
-An example of all the things that you want the AI to recognize
-Glitch.me

Process:
1.Pull up Teachable Machine on Google Chrome
2.Make sure the camera is open and not on the wrong way
3.Label your classes
4.Get your example and put it in front of the camera
5.Take enough pictures of your example
6.When you are done, train your model
7.Export your model IF you would like to
8.Put it on Glitch.me
9.Now your done! (We're done with this now!)
